# Hey, I am Trixx. A Bot which works with Prefixed Commands! [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/F2JGrrsag2) me now



## Installing the files

• You can either fork this repo or just download the zip.

• You can ever use `git clone https://github.com/AstroicyOP/Trixx` 

## Prerequisites

• Python 3.8+

• Java LTS 11+

• Check out the `requirements.txt` and install all the pakages. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them

• Make sure you have the [Lavalink.jar](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases) file and the [application.yml](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example) file too

## Getting Started!

Change the following:

• Make sure you have the `main.db` file in the `data/databases.js` directory

• A `config.py` file in the main directory with your [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/) api key, your bot's [TOKEN](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and your bot's [top.gg](https:/top.gg) TOKEN 

* Don't forget to rename all examples files to thier name.

# Running the bot

* Use `python3 main.py` and you are good to go!

# Self Hosting

* I recommend you do not try to install the whole code and copy it, since certain things here and there are not really defined, for example, token. Also the code will not work after 30th august. Some variables are stored in env files, so you might get a lot of undefined errors. You can copy the code of specific sections you want, but copying, say, the error handler will probably give you a lot of errors and not help you learn anything. Anyways you can self host it as public bot until 30th august after that you need to make the bot as private.

## Features 

-  Check mark is for openn source code features.
- X mark is for non open source code features, it's only used on public bot.
- We have carl bot functions but some of it's are private.
